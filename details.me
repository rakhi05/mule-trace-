# 🏦 Financial Forensics Engine (Money Muling Detection)
## *RIFT Hackathon Premier Edition*

---

### 🌟 Project Overview
The **Financial Forensics Engine** is a high-performance, intelligent platform designed to detect and visualize complex "Money Muling" networks. In modern financial crime, money muling involves moving illicit funds through a series of accounts to obfuscate their origin. This system provides investigators with a "Forensic Command Center" to ingest transaction data, run advanced graph algorithms, and generate actionable risk reports.

### 🛠 Technology Stack

#### **Frontend (The Visual Nervous System)**
-   **React (Vite)**: Ultra-fast, modern web framework.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Premium styling for a sleek, dark-themed forensic UI.
-   **Vis-network**: Robust data visualization library for interactive force-directed graph layouts.
-   **Lucide Icons**: High-fidelity iconography for UI clarity.

#### **Backend (The Analytical Brain)**
-   **Python (FastAPI)**: High-speed asynchronous API framework.
-   **NetworkX**: Industrial-grade graph theory library for network analysis.
-   **Pandas**: Powerhouse data manipulation for CSV processing and feature engineering.
-   **Uvicorn**: Lightning-fast ASGI server implementation.

### 🏗 System Architecture
The platform utilizes a **Decoupled Forensic Architecture**:
1.  **Ingestion Layer**: Sanitizes raw input (CSV) using fuzzy logic mapping to accommodate various bank statement formats.
2.  **Graph Synthesis Engine**: Translates transactional records into a multi-directed graph where accounts are nodes and transfers are directed edges.
3.  **Heuristic Intelligence Layer**: Executes specific forensic passes to identify topological red flags.
4.  **Risk Scoring Matrix**: A weighted normalization engine that calculates a 0-100 "Suspicion Score" for every entity.
5.  **Interactive Visualization**: A dynamic UI that allows users to "scrub" through time and deep-dive into suspicious clusters.

### 🧠 Algorithmic Deep Dive

#### **1. Circular Fund Routing (Cycles)**
-   **Concept**: Detects "U-turn" or "Ring" transactions where money eventually returns to a source or proxy.
-   **Mechanism**: Uses **Johnson’s Algorithm** (via NetworkX) to find circuits.
-   **Forensic Flag**: Cycles of length 3-5 are highly indicative of money laundering "carousel" schemes.

#### **2. Smurfing Detection (Fan-in / Fan-out)**
-   **Concept**: Identifies "Structuring" where many small transactions converge on one account (Fan-in) or one account distributes to many (Fan-out).
-   **Mechanism**: Implements a **Sliding 72-hour Temporal Window**. It triggers a flag if $>10$ distinct sources/destinations appear within a 3-day burst.

#### **3. Layered Shell Networks**
-   **Concept**: Identifies "Bridge" or "Pass-through" accounts that exist solely to add layers of complexity.
-   **Mechanism**: Linear chain traversal identifying accounts with strictly 2-3 transactions in a short timeframe and very low residence time for funds.

### 📊 Suspicion Score Methodology
The **Suspicion Score ($S$)** is calculated using a priority-weighted formula:
-   **Structuring (Smurfing)**: `+40 points` (Highest priority signal)
-   **Graph Cycles**: `+25 points`
-   **Layered Shell Chains**: `+20 points`
-   **High Velocity/Bursts**: `+15 points`

*Note: The engine includes a "Whitelist Logic" to filter out legitimate entities like payroll systems or known large-scale merchants.*

### 📖 One-Click Startup (Windows)
The project includes a `START_SYSTEM.bat` file which automates the entire deployment:
1.  **Environment Check**: Verifies Python and Node.js.
2.  **Dependency Alignment**: Installs `pip` and `npm` packages automatically.
3.  **Parallel Launch**: Fires up the FastAPI backend and Vite frontend simultaneously.
4.  **Auto-Load**: Launches your default browser to `localhost:5173`.

---

### 🚀 Usage Guide
1.  **Injest Data**: Upload custom bank data via CSV.
2.  **Generate Demo**: Use the "Load Demo Data" for a pre-configured crime network simulation.
3.  **Forensic Replay**: Click the **Play** button to watch transactions unfold chronologically.
4.  **Inspect**: Click any node (Red = High Risk) to generate an **AI Forensic Report** detailing its anomalies.

### 🏁 Future Roadmap
-   **ZKP Integration**: Zero-Knowledge Proofs for verification without exposing personal PII.
-   **Real-time WebSockets**: Live monitoring for active banking feeds.
-   **Deep Learning (GNN)**: Implementing Graph Neural Networks for predictive muling detection before the first transaction is complete.
